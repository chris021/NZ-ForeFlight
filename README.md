# NZ-ForeFlight
This Repo contains a collection of instructions and scripts to get the most out of ForeFlight in New Zealand.

NOTE: this Repo provides you with the detail on how to create maptiles and a BYOP (Bring your own plates) file for ForeFlight. You still need to purchase the charts from [Aeropath NZ](https://shop.aeropath.aero). For the AIP you must still carefully review the terms of use of the AIP site. [NZ AIP](https://www.aip.net.nz/disclaimer?BackURL=home)

If you do not have the technical skill or get stuck I am happy to help out in exchange for ForeFlight gift vouchers which ensures I keep these scripts upto date. Generous support of vouchers has keep this work alive. please contact me on Facebook, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chris021) or email chris(at)1c.co.nz
